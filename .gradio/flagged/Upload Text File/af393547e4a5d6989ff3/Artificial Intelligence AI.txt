Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the way we interact with technology. From smart assistants to autonomous vehicles, AI is embedded in our daily lives in subtle yet powerful ways. It encompasses various techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, to enable machines to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions.

One of AI's greatest strengths is its ability to automate complex tasks, significantly enhancing efficiency in industries such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. As AI continues to evolve, its ethical implications and challenges, including bias in decision-making and data security, must be addressed to ensure responsible development.
